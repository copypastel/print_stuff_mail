h2. Example

<pre>
  <code>
    require 'psm'
    
    # PrintStuffMail, aliased as PSM, is our namespace.
    # 1. set your account id.
    PSM.account_id = 'abcdefg' 
    
    # 2. mail a letter!
    # Since this method will eventually cause a credit card to be charged
    # we've taken extra precautions to label it as dangerous. The exclamation,
    # for one, calls attention to the method, but furthermore a block has to be
    # passed in "confirming" the method.
    PSM.mail!( 'message', 'address', 'return_address') {|c| c.confirm!}
    
    # 3. there is no step three.
  </code>
